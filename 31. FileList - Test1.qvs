Test Case: FileList Mask Order Test 1

Description: The test is pretty simple. We are going to create three files then read them back in using 
	the FileList mask and capture the order.

Conditions:
	 
	 ● File 1: z_Table
		○ Highest Alphabetical
		○ Lowest File Time
		○ Middle Size
	● File 2: m_Table
		○ Middle Alphabetical
		○ Middle File Time
		○ Highest Size
	● File 3: a_Table
		○ Lowest Alphabetical
		○ Highest File Time
		○ Lowest Size

*************************************************************************************************/

z_Table:
Load
	1 as FieldA
AutoGenerate
	(1000);

m_Table:
Load
	1 as FieldB
AutoGenerate
	(100000);

a_Table:
Load
	1 as FieldC
AutoGenerate
	(10);

result:
Load
	Num(Null()) as Order,
	Null() 		as File
AutoGenerate
	(0);


For each t in 'z_Table', 'm_Table', 'a_Table'

	Trace ---------------- $(t);
	Store $(t) into [C:\$(t).qvd](qvd);
	Drop Table $(t);
	
Next t

For each file in FileList('C:\*.qvd')

	Concatenate(result)
	Load
		RowNo() 	as Order,
		'$(file)' 	as File
	AutoGenerate
		(1);
		
Next file
